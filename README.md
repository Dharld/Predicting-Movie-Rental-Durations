## Introduction
**Title:** Introduction

**Description:**
The objective of this project is to create a regression model to predict the number of days a customer rents a DVD from a DVD rental company. Accurate predictions will enable the company to optimize their inventory, ensuring they have the right amount of stock on hand to meet customer demand.

## Data Collection
**Title:** Data Collection

**Description:**
The first step in building the regression model is to gather relevant data. The data required for this project includes:

- Customer rental history
- DVD rental duration
- DVD genre
- Rental dates
- Customer demographics

## Data Preprocessing
**Title:** Data Preprocessing

**Description:**
Once the data is collected, it needs to be cleaned and preprocessed. This involves:

- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Normalizing numerical features
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
**Title:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Description:**
EDA is performed to understand the underlying patterns and relationships within the data. Key steps include:

- Visualizing the distribution of rental durations
- Analyzing correlations between features
- Identifying potential outliers

## Model Selection
**Title:** Model Selection

**Description:**
Several regression models are implemented and compared to identify the best-performing model. The models considered include:

- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Decision Tree Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- Gradient Boosting Regression

## Model Evaluation
**Title:** Model Evaluation

**Description:**
Each model is evaluated using various performance metrics such as:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R-squared (RÂ²) score

## Recommendations
**Title:** Recommendations

**Description:**
Based on the model evaluation results, the best-performing model is recommended to the DVD rental company. This recommendation includes:

- A summary of the model's performance
- Key insights from the EDA
- Implementation considerations for the company

## Conclusion
**Title:** Conclusion

**Description:**
The project concludes with a summary of the findings, highlighting the benefits of the recommended model for the company's inventory planning.

## Future Work
**Title:** Future Work

**Description:**
Suggestions for future improvements and extensions of the project include:

- Incorporating additional features such as customer loyalty programs
- Exploring time series models for rental predictions
- Continuously updating the model with new data to maintain accuracy
