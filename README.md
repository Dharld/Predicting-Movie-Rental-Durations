DVD Rental Prediction Model
Project Description
A DVD rental company has approached you to develop a regression model to predict the number of days a customer rents a DVD. The goal is to improve their inventory planning and overall efficiency. This project involves running multiple regression models, evaluating their performance, and recommending the best model to the company.

Introduction
The objective of this project is to create a regression model to predict the number of days a customer rents a DVD from a DVD rental company. Accurate predictions will enable the company to optimize their inventory, ensuring they have the right amount of stock on hand to meet customer demand.

Data Collection
The first step in building the regression model is to gather relevant data. The data required for this project includes:

Customer rental history
DVD rental duration
DVD genre
Rental dates
Customer demographics
Data Preprocessing
Once the data is collected, it needs to be cleaned and preprocessed. This involves:

Handling missing values
Encoding categorical variables
Normalizing numerical features
Splitting the data into training and testing sets
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is performed to understand the underlying patterns and relationships within the data. Key steps include:

Visualizing the distribution of rental durations
Analyzing correlations between features
Identifying potential outliers
Model Selection
Several regression models are implemented and compared to identify the best-performing model. The models considered include:

Linear Regression
Ridge Regression
Lasso Regression
Decision Tree Regression
Random Forest Regression
Gradient Boosting Regression
Model Evaluation
Each model is evaluated using various performance metrics such as:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R-squared (RÂ²) score
Recommendations
Based on the model evaluation results, the best-performing model is recommended to the DVD rental company. This recommendation includes:

A summary of the model's performance
Key insights from the EDA
Implementation considerations for the company
Conclusion
The project concludes with a summary of the findings, highlighting the benefits of the recommended model for the company's inventory planning.

Future Work
Suggestions for future improvements and extensions of the project include:

Incorporating additional features such as customer loyalty programs
Exploring time series models for rental predictions
Continuously updating the model with new data to maintain accuracy
